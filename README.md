# VBA log processor

This was designed for a Windows server where I had no access to any tools other than MS Office.

This is a quick hack for automated txt and csv log processing with a couple of manual steps. For improvement, the manual steps could be automated as well, the current way gave more control in case of errors. The logs are always in the same format, so the code looks for specific phrases in the file.

You manually select the log output folder from the program this was designed for and the vba runs through all the csv and txt files and gathers information from them.
This saves a lot of time by removing the need to go through each log manually and gathering data for reports.

All the identifying information and data is obfuscated with only example output left.
